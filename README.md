# #NVJOB Water Shaders V2.x. Free Unity Asset.

### Information

#NVJOB Water Shaders V2.x are fast and easy water shaders running on mobile and desktop platforms. The asset includes two shaders, Specular and Surface. 
In shaders, real-time reflections are implemented. Water over time changes the direction vector, the direction of movement changes in a circle. 
You can also set the direction of water movement (for example, synchronize the direction of water with the direction of the Wind Zone). 
Supported rendering path deferred and forward (DepthTextureMode).
This shader is well suited for decorative purposes, in scenes where water is not a key element.
